# Identification of GCA specific T cell clones

Due to my recent Covid infection, I cannot come to the workshop in person. If you are interested in my work or have any question, please do not hesitate to contact me at wbr@zurich.ibm.com 

## Background/ Objectives 
Arterial wall inflammation in giant cell arteritis (GCA) is characterised by T-cell infiltration and the formation of granulomas with macrophages. A strong MHC II association with GCA suggests that antigen-specific immune processes may play a crucial role in GCA pathogenesis. However, to date there have been limited studies investigating the prevalence of T-cell clones in GCA lesions. Here we present an analysis on T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of blood and temporal artery biopsy samples from 26 GCA patients. We aimed to identify disease specific T-cell clones shared by GCA patients. Analysis of TCR sequences is a first step towards identifying a potential auto-antigen. 
## Methods
We compared the TCR sequences identified through bulk TCR sequencing of blood and biopsy tissue of GCA patients to those found in control groups. Controls were made up of 41 patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), 30 healthy subjects as well as a publicly available additional dataset containing TCR repertoires of 627 healthy individuals. 
## Results 
We identified 49 TCRs that exclusively occur in GCA patients. Each of them was found in the biopsy samples of at least 8 different GCA patients. These T-cells may be involved in the disease processes and were also detected in the blood of the patient as well as the biopsy. The GCA-specific TCRs show preferential use of certain V and J segments, which is in line with the known MHC association of GCA. Clustering of patients based on the TCRs identified in their biopsy samples results in three distinct patient groups that did not correlate with age or sex of the individuals. Further studies are underway to expand this cohort and explore association with GCA clinical phenotype.
## Conclusions 
These preliminary results suggest that certain TCRs are typical for and specific to GCA patients. Further studies will investigate association with more refractory disease and persistence following treatment, to determine if they may identify a subgroup of patients who would benefit from T-cell targeted therapies. Further analysis of sequence patterns may ultimately reveal whether these TCRs bind a common autoantigen providing further insights into disease pathogenesis.
